# C++ Version
## Features
1. A **numpy** like numerical algebra toolkit **numcpp** is implemented in [numerical_cpp.cpp](https://github.com/ArtificialIntelligenceBirdMan/Data-Mining-ML/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression/C%2B%2B/numerical_cpp.cpp), and the same API interface is retained, which is very user-friendly. For example, you can use `numcpp nc` to declare the tool **nc** just like `import numpy as np`, then you can use `nc.matmul`, `nc.mean` just like `np.matmul`, `np.mean` in **Python**.

## To be improved
1. The efficiency of some algorithms needs to be optimized such as **matrix multiplication**.
2. The template class function has not been implemented yet.
3.
